# AI Red Team Bytes

**AI Red Team Bytes** is a collection of **bite-sized, intuition-first explanations of AI risks, failures, and blind spots**, created to help learners and practitioners understand **how AI systems break in the real world**.

This repository focuses on **AI Red Teaming** — the practice of intentionally stress-testing AI systems to uncover bias, misuse, unsafe behavior, and unintended consequences.

## What This Repository Is For

Most AI learning materials focus on:
- Model performance
- Accuracy and benchmarks
- Architecture and optimization

But real-world AI failures usually come from:
- Biased data
- Poor problem framing
- Overconfidence in model outputs
- Lack of testing across people, contexts, and edge cases

**AI Red Team Bytes** exists to bridge that gap.

It helps you learn how to:
- Think like a red teamer
- Question AI outputs instead of trusting them
- Identify hidden risks before deployment
- Explain AI failures clearly to non-technical audiences

## What You Will Find Here

Each “byte” in this repository is designed to be:
- **Short** – easy to consume in one sitting
- **Story-driven** – grounded in real-world scenarios
- **Concept-focused** – one risk or failure mode at a time
- **Tool-agnostic** – applicable across models and platforms

Topics include (but are not limited to):
- Bias and fairness failures
- Automation bias and over-trust
- Hallucinations in high-stakes settings
- Feedback loops and data leakage
- Prompt injection and misuse scenarios
- Misaligned objectives and unintended incentives

---

## What This Repository Is *Not*

- Not a math-heavy AI textbook  
- Not a model implementation repository  
- Not tied to a specific vendor or framework  

The goal is **intuition and critical thinking**, not optimization.

---

## Who This Repository Is For

- Beginners learning Responsible AI
- ML practitioners expanding into AI governance or safety
- Interview candidates preparing for real-world AI risk questions
- Product managers, consultants, and leaders working with AI systems

If you can explain an AI failure clearly, you understand AI better.

## Philosophy

> A model can be accurate and still be harmful.  
> A system can work as designed and still be wrong.

AI Red Teaming is about finding those gaps **before users do**.

---

## How to Use This Repository

- Read one concept at a time
- Focus on *why* the failure happened, not just *what* happened
- Practice explaining each concept in simple language
- Think about how the same risk could appear in other domains

Examples in this repository are simplified and educational.
They are intended to illustrate concepts, not to evaluate or accuse specific organizations or systems.

**Think critically.  
Test assumptions.
